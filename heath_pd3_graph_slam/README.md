# Usage

After catkin and roscore prep, run
```rosrun heath_pd3_graph_slam heath_pd3_graphlam.py```
in one terminal window and then
```rosbag play 2020-01-27-20-09-52.bag```
in another.

Once the bagfile finishes playing, hit 'Enter' in the ROS node's terminal window to perform the Graph-SLAM optimization and plot the results.
